# fileremover
Java Desktop application for removing files or directories. 

This is a little project I made a long time ago for solving myself the "long name file deletion problem in windows XP", then I tested on the next windows until Windows 10. 

I refactored it to make it public for everyone having the same problem:

(sorry for the shi..y videos ^^)

And I just make a little refactor again to make the code public. It is old ugly code, I hope you can enhance it. 
You can fork it, make it better (preferrably) I only ask you won't sell it as your own work. 

To run it, just install the Java runtime and in the dist directory command:
java -jar FileRemover.jar

Please notify me of any bug, issue, or constructive complaint.
